## Separated Servers
In the master branch, you have two different folders, client (the Angular app) and server (an Express application offering REST API endpoints).

The applications can be examined separately.

You may run the Angular client with npm start in the client directory (after npm install, of course).

You may run the API server with node index.js (or nodemon index.js) in the server directory (after npm install, of course).
